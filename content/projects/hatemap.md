December 2024

This interactive map built with Python, JavaScript, and D3 visualizes rates of hate crimes per capita across the United States. I began this project in fall of 2024, when rumors about Haitian immigrants led to increased hate crimes against Haitian communities in Springfield, Ohio. I wanted to understand more about which populations in the U.S. were particularly vulnerable to targeted violence, and where this violence occurs. 

Users can click on the button below to access the dynamic map, which allows users to focus on specific types of hate crimes and click on specific states to learn more. This project was my first foray into interactive visualizations (and JavaScript), so the JS learning curve was definitely steep!
