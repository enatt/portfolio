As part of my graduation from the Plan II Honors Program at the University of Texas at Austin, I wrote a thesis applying sentiment analysis algorithms to U.S. party convention speeches. 

This project is written entirely in R Markdown, using the syuzhet and sentimentr packages to apply various natural language processing and sentiment analysis algorithms. I was interested in discovering quantitative differences in the way that different political candidates spoke. After analyzing over 90 speeches
from 1992-2020, I applied various statistical methods including bootstrapped analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect the statistical significance in speeches delivered by men, women, Democrats, and Republicans.

I found that, for the given sample, men and women were equally "emotional." While women were 1% more joyful in their speeches than men, candidates of both genders expressed equal amounts of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and other emotions.
